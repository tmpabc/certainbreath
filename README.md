## Introduction

Certain Breath is a device developed to help combat the problem of [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome). Unexplained deaths from SIDS occur at a rate of up to 1 in 1000 infants aged mostly from 28 days to 1 year.

## Device functionality

Certain Breath is a infant sleeping monitor that tracks the respiratory rate of the infant using high-sensitivity force sesnors. The data is collected and analysed locally and sent off for external (dev/ web application) visualisation. Parents and people nearby are notified of any abnormalies in the respiratory functions through push-notifications and local means (i.e. LEDs or sound).
