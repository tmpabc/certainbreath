## Introduction

Certain Breath is a device developed to help combat the problem of [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome). Unexplained deaths from SIDS occur at a rate of up to 1 in 1000 infants aged mostly from 28 days to 1 year.

With a wide range of available electronic sensors and the worldwide spreading of the internet of things (IoT), hobbyist are now equipped to build their own embedded projects, whether its for convenience (see [app controlled garage door](https://www.amazon.co.uk/OWSOO-Controller-Compatible-Control-Function/dp/B07FM6HMZ6)), for increased productivity (see [real-time in-ear translator](https://github.com/steven-king/660-storytelling-vr/wiki/Emerging-Tech:-Pilot)) or for fun (see [lightening detector](http://runtimeprojects.com/2016/02/a-lightning-detector-for-arduino/)).

With Certain Breath we aim to create a simple real-time application to tackle SIDS. Through these pages we provide a comprehensive guide of desiging and building your own baby monitor using the Raspberry Pi.

## Device functionality

Certain Breath is a infant sleeping monitor that tracks the respiratory rate of the infant using high-sensitivity force sesnors. The data is collected and analysed locally and sent off for external (dev/ web application) visualisation. Parents and people nearby are notified of any abnormalies in the respiratory functions through push-notifications and local means (i.e. LEDs or sound).
